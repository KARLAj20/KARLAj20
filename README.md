- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @KARLAj20

I am a student of mechatronic engineering, in my repositories you can find a base of some projects in 'STM32F7XXXX' (SOFTWARE KEIL),
classes created in neatbeens and codes in c, c ++, java and python, also projects in matlab.

I hope that all the information in my repositories can be of help for new programmers and for the community in general that needs it.

All the codes that are uploaded are bases that can be used in different projects, for that reason at the beginning of each code it is
indicated that it is needed to run each code correctly.

- What interest me ? ðŸ˜œðŸ‘€ðŸ‘€

topics are systems of: control, automation and optimization.
